## Background

With this Pattern, we demonstrate a horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use cases.

It is derived from the [work](https://github.com/sa-mw-dach/manuela) done by Red
Hat Middleware Solution Architects in Germany in 2019/20. It has been updated with an advanced GitOps framework.

The specific example is live defect detection based on sensor data in an
industrial setting, but it could easily be applicable to other verticals.

### Solution elements

- How to use a GitOps approach to keep in control of configuration and operations
- How to centrally manage multiple clusters, including workloads
- How to build and deploy workloads across clusters using modern CI/CD
- How to train AI/ML models in the public cloud with data from the private cloud, and bring the executable model back to on prem.
- IoT Edge

### Red Hat Technologies

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Kubernetes++)
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (Open Clutser Management)
- Red Hat OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
- Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)
- Red Hat Quay (Container image registry)
- Red Hat AMQ (Apache ActiveMQ)
- Red Hat AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka Event Broker)
- Red Hat Integration (Apache Camel-K)
- Open Data Hub

## Architecture

The following diagram explains how different roles have different concerns and focus when working with this distributed AL/ML architecture.

### Logical Architecture

In the Industrial Edge architecture there are two logical sites.

- The datacenter. This is where the data scientist, developers and operations personnel apply the changes to their models, application code and configurations.
- The factory. This is where new applications, updates and operational changes are deployed to improve quality and efficency in the factory.

### Physical Schema 

The diagram below shows the components that are deployed in the datacenter and the factory and the networking between those components.

The diagram below shows the components are are deployed in the datacenter and the factory and the dataflows between those components across the various networks.

While the above diagrams show the components involved on the DevOps side dealing with the application and the AI/ML models, there are other components to conside when dealing with operational side using GitOps.

## Recorded Demo

## Prerequisties

1. An OpenShift cluster ( Go to https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create )
1. (Optional) A second OpenShift cluster for the factory (edge).
1. A github account
1. A quay account

## Initial Deployment

Follow the instructions in the [Git
repo](https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns/industrial-edge/#how-to-use)
containing the complete configuration.

## Validating the Environment

Check to see that all Operators have been deployed

  ```
  OpenShift UI -> Installed Operators
  ```
The entire deployment involves several OpenShift GitOps applications. It takes time to deploy everything. You may have to go back and forth between this step and the next step to make sure
that all the operators are deployed. 

Check all OpenShift GitOps applications are synchronised

  a. Obtain the ArgoCD console urls and passwords

  ```
  for name in openshift datacenter factory; do oc -n $name-gitops get route $name-gitops-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'; echo ; oc -n $name-gitops extract secrets/$name-gitops-cluster --to=-; done
  ```

  a. Log in using the userid `admin` and the provided generated passowrd. There will be a number and check for green applications
